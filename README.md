## Telegram bot:
Bots are third-party applications that run inside Telegram. Users can interact with bots by sending them messages, commands and inline requests. You control your bots using HTTPS requests to our bot API.
The Bot API is an HTTP-based interface created for developers keen on building bots for Telegram.
